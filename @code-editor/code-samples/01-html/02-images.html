        <!-- And this is how you add images -->
        <!-- Observe the use of a relative path -->
        <!-- This is very handy when a website is moved from a domain to another or 
            when files are moved from one location to another. -->
        <!-- Relative paths indicate relations between folders -->
        <!-- Absolute paths give you the full adress and they can be quite inflexible sometimes -->

        <!-- On challenging task in the beginning is knowing where to put your files -->
        <!-- There are a few conventions that you can use -->
        <!-- For basic projects just create subfolders for images, icons, css, javascript, etc -->
        <!-- I preffered to use an /assets subfolder because I want to keep all the other files together -->
        <!-- This is meant to reduce the number of distracting elements while studying -->
        <!-- Right now it's important that you give attention to the lessons, not to the assets -->
        <!-- In later chapters we will also learn some of the more sophisticated 
                ways to structure files in you projects -->

        <!-- And also dimensions -->
        <!-- However setting dimensions in html is not recommended -->
        <!-- This is called hardcoding and it is considered a bad practice for several reasons -->
        <!-- Hardcoding dimensions makes them really difficult to change on the fly by the web app -->
        <!-- The code becomes less flexible to change -->
        <!-- Bit there are exceptions. You may want to put dimensions in order to 
            keep a layout intact even tough the page has not loaded yet -->
        <!-- However, be careful, improper dimensions can make a picture look ugly -->
        <img src="assets/images/REST-meme.jpeg" width="600" height="200">

        <!-- When only one dimension is defined the other is automatically calculated 
            using the original image aspect ratio -->

        <!-- Quick demo on how CSS works -->
        <!-- This is called changing styles inline -->
        <!-- It is not recommeded to do this for the same reasons that setting image dimensions is not usually recomended -->
        <!-- I would recommend to keep good habits even wehn working for personal projects -->
        <!-- only quick proof of concept tests may be allowed to have such styles just to save time while testing solutions -->
        <p style="color:blue;">Also observe the first demonstration of BLUE text :D</p>

        <!-- We will talk about HEX and RGBA notations in CSS chapter  -->
        <!-- However I need some CSS in order to show some ways image positioning can be affected -->
        <p style="color:#ff0000;">How about red in hex notation (#ff0000)?</p>

        <!-- Observe how previous images are placed one after the other -->
        <!-- This is called inline position -->
        <!-- It follows the principle of text placement -->
        <!-- When a line of text reachs the end of the available space it will break and start again from the left side -->
        <!-- This behavior is default for images and text -->
        <!-- However we cam force the images to go one after the other using several methods -->

        <!-- Placing an image in a <p> tag -->
        <p>
            <img src="assets/images/REST-meme.jpeg" width="200">
        </p>

        <!-- Using break line attribute -->
        <img src="assets/images/REST-meme.jpeg" width="100">
        <br>

        <!-- Or using CSS properties -->

        <!-- Display block -->
        <!-- Best method to obtain this behavior, I will explain in CSS lesson why is this so. -->
        <p><img src="assets/images/REST-meme.jpeg" style="display:block" width="80"></p>

        <!-- Clear line left or right -->
        <!-- Prevents other elements for continuing the line on both sides left and righ. Seldom used -->
        <img src="assets/images/REST-meme.jpeg" style="clear:both" width="80">

        <!-- Also observe the use of alternative text for images that have failed to load.--> 
        <!-- Maybe because of network failure -->
        <!-- These alternative descriptions are very handy for blind users who use screen readers -->
        <!-- Also search engines make use of them to better understand image content -->

        <!-- Ok now lets try an image loaded from another server (Mirroring) -->
        <!-- BTW -->
        <!-- It's ok if you don't understand the joke right now -->
        <!-- After reading chapter 8 this joke will make total sense. -->
        <!-- For now lets just say that programmers are really passionate about programming and 
            some of them can start fights just to proove that their favorite technology is better -->

        <!-- Images can also stretch to the width of the document, but this can be achieved only via CSS. -->
        <!-- Html alone is not enough -->
        <!-- You may notive that the image is very blury. That is because the original resolution is too low. -->
        <!-- More will be discussed in future lessons -->
