How to learn programming *fast*


## Objectives of this course
- Learn the **essentials** of **programming for the web** in less than **4 weeks**.
- Understand how **websites** and **web applications** are developed, deployed and maintained.
- Experience the latest techniques and tools used in **modern web development**.
- Receive plenty of **examples and support** along the way.
- Learn what actual developers do and discover **real life scenarios**.
- Gain a **solid foundation** on to which further knowledge can be added by **individual study** following the recepies explained here.
- Get a **clear overview** of how software is created.
- Explore **multiple branches** of web development and server side programming.

## This course is perfect for you if you:
- Desire to start learning programming and Javascript in particular. 
- Don't have any previous programming experience. 
- Dislike reading books and waiting forever without understanding how the big picture works.
- Want to study in your own rythm without feeling pressure from a professor.
- Have limited time available for study.
- Wish to make a big change of career.
- Or even just wanna have some fun and learn something new.

## How this works
The **main objective** of this course is to provide you the fastest way towards **total autonomy in learning** web development. This might seem odd compared to books and other materials that want to give in depth explanations about each subject. But let me give you a tip. A 500 page book is not exhilarating... you need it now, fast. Right?

The most painful sensation during web development is the frustration of feeling lost, unaware if what you are building is good or not. This builds up again the sensation of lost freedom and drains down the motivation. What you need is to feel empowered, capable of jumping ships at any moment.

This is possible by consolidating two main skills: **spatial awareness** knowing what solutions are available and recommended and **knowledge gathering** knowing were to find the missing pieces fast.

You can skip chapters or lessons if you feel so. I totally recommend it, enjoy the freedom in your own pace. Maybe you want to check something fresh or you are already ready to jump into your first real project. Consider this as the place where zou can return for directions if you feel lost out there.

## Method of teaching
- This course is carefully crafted to emulate the typical learning cycle of most frontend developers. This usually implies:
    - Formulating a **description** of the problem using standard programming jargon
    - **Searching** online for information. Links will be provided for quick orientation.
    - Evaluating multiple **solutions** to find which one is better suited to solve the current problem.
    - Applying the **fix** in a real life scenario.

## Support material and examples
The material that will be provided is minimalistic in nature. It is inteded to be used as a notebook full of valuable notes. The actual knowledge will be a lot of times out there, on the web, waiting to be discovered. So let's call this for what it is: **a roadmap**. A carefuly constructed one, capable of guiding you trough the journey of learning via the **fastest route**.

As a metaphor I will use the example of construction workers. In construction there are lots of tools and techniques that a skilled laborer needs to know. However, for all of us it's preety easy to understand what are the steps in constructing buildings. It is easy to tell what are the **essential tools** and which ones are the specialised ones. It's preety easy to figure out **standard practices** and to recognize when a **innovative building technique** is applied. 

Unfortunately this is not so easy said about programming. The tools are not visible and palpable. The buildings are not tabgible and they are almost impossbile to tear down by the average person. What each skilled programmer needs is a mental map of all the tools and all the commond techniques used in building software. 

My intention is to provide this map using a series revealing examples that will teach zou the ins and outs of crafting software.

So let's put the safety googles, power-up the electric grinder and let's break this black box open!

## Index
- **01 - Basic Html** Learn the basic tools and materials used in constructing the structure of a webpage. Html is the scaffolding onto which webapps are built.
- **02 - Tools and Software** Learn what are the most common used tools in web app development and understand theyr purpose.
- **03 - Basic Javascript** If html is the skeletton, javascript is the brain and muscles of a webapp. Learn the basic ingredients necessary to write code.
- **04 - Object Oriented Javascript** After learning how to utilise the basic ingridients zou will start writting long scripts. But after a while zou hit a wall. Somehow you need to organize your code so that it has a recognisible structure. This is where OOP comes in.
- **05 - Functional programming** Well, OOP is nice and it gives code structure, but abusing OOP can lead to even worse problems. Logic mixed together with data so tight that it cannot be untangled anymore... meaning spagheti code. This is were pure functions help you to maintain sanity.
- **06 - Production environment** Ok so now you know how to keep your code nice and clean avoiding to buil a labyrinth. But this needs to run on real servers with real users...
- **07 - Ecmascript 6** Javascript is always evolving and the latest version is by far the best. Learn what makes it so special and how it saves development time.
- **08 - Asynchronous Javascript** This is usually were the brain starts melting. The order of code is broken by network traffic, and it starts jumping from on place to another almost feeling like it has no clear path. Well, there are ways to keep this under control :D
- **09 - Frameworks** Programming can become tedious and repetitive. Frameworks take the repetitive parts out of the process. You get to spend your energy on the code that is making your app unique.
- **10 - Architecture patterns** After a while some patterns emerge. The same solutions keep reoccuring. These have been labeled and can be highly reusable for lots of situations.
- **11 - Web graphics (2D, 3D)** Today, user inderfaces have to work hard to stand out as inovative and interesting. Taking advantage of interactive graohics is a must.
- **12 - User experience** Let's not forget for who we are buoilding this for. In the end the user is zour judge. No matter what you think he will have the power of life or death over your app.
- **13 - Server apps** Current generation of frontend apps are almost standalone apps. but they still need databases and access points and help when computation becomes intensive.
- **14 - Development process** Let's do a quck review on how al of this fits together with the clients needs and real life chalanges such as paying salaries.
- **15 - Working as a developer** What can you expect from your new career as a developer.
- **16 - Building a real app** This is where the rubber hits the road. Now zou are ready to actually build something useful for other people.
- **17 - Security** We are more and more reliant on the technology that powers the web. That leaves us exposed to malicious agents unless we take steps to protect our data. 
- **18 - Performance** After all, electricity costs money, so you want ot use it wisely that includes also how eficient yor code runs, not to mention that nothing makes an user more angry than a slughis UI.
- **19 - Game development** Learn what makes games work. These techniques can improve your presentational skills to PRO level. VR is the future and you need to understand it.
- **20 - Visual Space** The next generation of web interfaces will be powered by strong UI with a touch of AI and 3D graphics. This is as close as we can get to the holodeck here in 2017.

**A few notes**
- This document will be constantly updated with the latest techniques in javascript.
- Currently this document is work in progress so be patient and keep revisiting the repository.
- I strongly discourage taking notes. This course is supposed to be your actual notebook so you can have your hands and mind free to work, not collecting and organising notes.
- **Remember** You will feel unconfortable for a long while. This is natural. This indicates progress, you are growing. Embrace this feeling, learn to love it. This is how you get ahead in life. Somewhere along the line you will make the transition and you will feel the true power of programming knowledge. Stay ambitious, don't throw the towel yet! Make me proud!

## Motivation for writting these tutorials
Confession: **I was a terrible student**. I always got bored and often I felt unable to keep the pace with the school curriculum. This has many explanations but the main one was that I felt a complete loss of freedom. When freedom is constrained you tend to loose motivation and interest. This has continued for me even after K12. I ended up being a dropdout after just half of semester in economics university.

Somehow I was trapped between high hopes, big expectations, social pressure, impenetrable barriers and crushed dreams. Each time I started something new I lost steam quite fast and I ended ditching the plans just after a few weeks.

Yet, somehow **a miracle happened**... sort of. I had these two burning passions: technology and arts. I loved reading stuff about computers and browsing cool artwork online. Eventually this opened my way towards a career in webdesign. I spent a few years as a web designer with mixed results always trying to improve.

Eventually I took the big leap and I ventured into programming. It was a rough start. Everything was strange and nothing made sense. For a long period I felt a lot of **insecurity about my code and techniques**. Nothing that I built seemed to be even close to acceptable by the standards.

In time I got better and I made it on the other side. Today I'm leading a small, but growing, frontend team writting web applications used in the banking sector utilising the latest and greatest techniques. I have broad experience covering the full spectrum of the software development process. in the spare time I work at my own personal project which I hope to push into production in the near future.

Today it is really clear what were the past mistakes, were I have lost time and what were the roadblocks in this learning journey. I wish to share this knowledge with you in order to spare you the frustrations and possible failures that can occur during this period of learning. This is all about motivation and spatial orientation. A professional feels really good about himself when he is aware of the solutions that solve the problems he faces in his daily work. This is the feeling I wish to give you while finishing this course.

Now let's see how this is going to work.
