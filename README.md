## This course is perfect for you if you:
- Desire to start learning programming and Javascript in particular. 
- Don't have any previous programming experience. 
- Dislike reading books and waiting forever without understanding how the big picture works.
- Want to study in your own rythm without feeling pressure from a professor.
- Have limited time available for study.
- Wish to make a big change of career.
- Or even just wanna have some fun and learn something new.

<br><br><br>
## How this works
The **main objective** of this course is to provide you the fastest way towards **total autonomy in learning** web development. This might seem odd compared to books and other materials that want to give in depth explanations about each subject. But let me give you a tip. A 500 page book is not exhilarating... you need it now, fast. Right?

The most painful sensation during web development is the frustration of feeling lost, unaware if what you are building is good or not. This builds up again the sensation of lost freedom and drains down the motivation. What you need is to feel empowered, capable of jumping ships at any moment.

This is possible by consolidating two main skills: **spatial awareness** knowing what solutions are available and commonly used and **knowledge gathering** knowing were to find the missing pieces fast.

You can skip chapters or lessons if you feel so. I totally recommend it, enjoy the freedom in your own pace. Maybe you want to check something fresh or you are already ready to jump into your first real project. Consider this as the place where you can return for directions if you feel lost out there.

<br><br><br> 
## Method of teaching
This course is carefully crafted to emulate the typical learning cycle of most frontend developers. This usually implies:

- Formulating a **description** of the problem using standard programming jargon.
- **Searching** online for information. Links will be provided for quick orientation.
- Evaluating multiple **solutions** to find which one is better suited for solving the current problem.
- Applying the **fix** in a real life scenario.
- Learning additional knowledge in litle steps, and **applying repetition**.

**REMEMBER This course is not designed to teach all subjects in great detail. You will not be proficient in these technologies from day one. However, you will have a good understanding of what can be done using these technologies. When the time comes in your current project you will have the skills necessary to understand current problem and than research online for solutions.** 

This is standard practice in Frontend development due to the rapid technology cycle and the abundance of tutorials. Even today I do not know by heart the syntax used to load an external CSS style. Each time I have to look it up again. Why? Because It happens so rarely and there are so many other notions that I have to remember. My brain simple refuses to register this syntax unles I start using it often. However I am acutely aware of all the implications of loading an external stylesheet. I can talk for an extended period about the various nuances of this subject. This comes from long exposure to a lot of projects. 

**This is where the next step comes in: REPETITION BY WORK. Building new software you are very often exposed to the same names over and over again. This is the point where things that you learned stick for ever.** 

So this is my deal: I give you the map and orientation indications. After finishing this 101 class it's up to you to consolidate what you have learned by aplying it to your own project. Doing exercises might be fun, but the real fun is building actual software :D

## How the content is structured
I tried to isolate the main disciplines required for web development. Each one of these disciplines has a folder with a chapter number and a chapter name. Inside each of these folders you will find lessons designed to be finished in one day (arround 4 to 8 hours). Each individual lesson will have the following sections:

Lesson section | Description
--- | ---
**What is X** | Basic description of the technology or technique.
**Why was it created** | What needs were satisfied by utilising this technology.
**What can it do** | The big overview. Each of these chapters can be drilled down in 500 pages books. What I want to explain is the big picture. The overview, how everything fits together. This way I give you the power of deciding what to study and when is this study required to unlock new skills.
**Why it matters** | How does this technology help you build web applications. What are the benefits of using it.
**Tasks** | These are tasks designed to quickly showcase the behavior of the presented tehcniques. You will also find explanations of how a particular task can be useful in real world. In order to increase the chance that the brain will actually asimilate the information I will leave a bit of room for interpretation for these tasks. They have an objective but it is not strictly stated how to obtain the end result. This is where you enter in *developer mode* and try to find the solution to the problem. This is the most potent process in fixing information in the long term memory. And also the most fun one. If you feel a task might not be intereseting, just skip ahead. However the other part of the story is the *getting confirmation mode* so for this I will provide sampeles of code for all the tasks. *I challange you to solve the tasks yourslef* but if you are in a hurry I can live with this. I do it myself a lot of the time. I just go to samples, see it, memorise it and than fly away to the next lesson. But I think this is more likely to work if you have a solid foundation, meaning some expirience. it's up to you to make this choice.
**Real life situations** | These examples are designed to give you a succint presentation of the common ways these techniques can be used to achieve certain real life goals. This is the part that is lacking in other materials the most. You learn one example of a technique and one applied situation, but you are totally unaware of the many possibilities that are available. This is usually compensated by years of work and seeing samples of code from other projects. I'll try to provide as many examples as possible. In time I will keep adding examples as I recall them myself.
**Search for** | These are examples of search queries I used over the years in order to find out new information. These will be really useful in fixing the technical jargon in place. It's hard to find solutions if you don't use the proper terms to describe them.
**More** | In case you are really keen on digging deeper in a specific subject, these will be references to more advanced subjects.
**Links** | In most cases I will provide links to more detailed articles that explain the subject in more detailed manner while also keeping the learning curve low.
**Remember** | Instead of you keeping notes I will keep them for you. No, really! Stop wasting time, go and have some fun. Information is always at search result away. Enjoy the extra time!

## Support material and examples
The material that will be provided is minimalistic in nature. It is inteded to be used as a notebook full of valuable notes. The actual knowledge will be a lot of times out there, on the web, waiting to be discovered. So let's call this for what it is: **a roadmap**. A carefuly constructed one, capable of guiding you trough the journey of learning via the **fastest route**.

As a metaphor I will use the example of construction workers. In construction there are lots of tools and techniques that a skilled laborer needs to know. However, for all of us it's pretty easy to understand what are the steps in constructing buildings. It is easy to tell what are the **essential tools** and which ones are the specialised ones. It's pretty easy to figure out **standard practices** and to recognize when an **innovative building technique** is applied. 

Unfortunately this is not so easy said about programming. The tools are not visible and palpable. The projects are not tangible and they are almost impossbile to tear down by the average person. What each skilled programmer needs is a mental map of all the tools and all the common techniques used in building software. 

My intention is to provide this map using a series revealing examples that will teach you the ins and outs of crafting software. From my expirience, half the effort is gathering the knowledge, being aware that certain techniques exist. The other half is just pinning down what syntax will work. I'm trying to help on both sides. The lessons are like maps of knowledge and the samples are notebooks of good syntax. Once you have these secured than you have more freedom to actually write software instead of constantly researching. 

So let's put the safety googles, power-up the electric grinder and let's break this black box open!

## Index
Chapter | Description
--- | ---
**01 - [Basic Html](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-school/tree/master/01-basic-html)** | Learn the basic tools and materials used in constructing the structure of a webpage. Html is the scaffolding onto which webapps are built.
**02 - Basic Javascript** | If html is the skeletton, javascript is the brain and muscles of a webapp. Learn the basic ingredients necessary to write code.
**03 - Ecmascript 6** | Javascript is always evolving and the latest version is by far the best. Learn what makes it so special and how it saves development time.
**04 - Object Oriented Javascript** | After learning how to utilise the basic ingredients you will start writting long scripts. But after a while you hit a wall. Somehow you need to organize your code so that it has a recognisible structure. This is where OOP comes in.
**05 - Functional programming** | Well, OOP is nice and it gives code structure, but abusing OOP can lead to even worse problems. Logic mixed together with data so tight that it cannot be untangled anymore... meaning spaghetti code. This is were pure functions help you to maintain sanity.
**06 - Asynchronous Javascript** | This is usually were the brain starts melting. The order of code execution is mixed by network traffic, and it starts jumping from on place to another almost feeling like it has no clear path. Well, there are ways to keep this under control :D
**07 - Production environment** | Learn what are the most common used tools in web app development and understand their purpose. Now you know how to keep your code nice and clean avoiding to build a labyrinth. But this needs to run on real servers with real users...
**08 - Frameworks** | Programming can become tedious and repetitive. Frameworks take the repetitive parts out of the process. You get to spend your energy on the code that is making your app unique.
**09 - Architecture patterns** | After a while some patterns emerge. The same solutions keep reoccuring. These have been studied and labeled by experienced developers. Patterns can be highly reusable for lots of situations, saving time and effort.
**10 - Web components** | Learn what are the technologies of the future and how they can greatly improve the development process of web applications.
**11 - Web graphics (2D, 3D)** | Today, user inderfaces have to work hard to stand out as inovative and interesting. Taking advantage of interactive graphics is a must.
**12 - Server apps** | Current generation of frontend apps are almost standalone apps. But they still need databases and access points and help when computation becomes intensive.
**13 - Development process** | Let's do a quck review on how all of this fits together with the clients needs and real life chalanges such as paying salaries.
**14 - Building a real app** | This is where the rubber hits the road. Now you are ready to actually build something useful for other people.
**15 - Performance** | After all, electricity costs money, so you want to use it wisely. That includes also how eficient yor code runs, not to mention that nothing makes an user more angry than a sluggish UI.
**16 - Security** | We are more and more reliant on the technology that powers the web. That leaves us exposed to malicious agents unless we take steps to protect our data.
**17 - User experience** | Let's not forget for who we are building this for. In the end the user is your judge. No matter what you believe, he will have the power of life or death over your app.
**18 - Game development** | Learn what makes games work. These techniques can improve your presentational skills to PRO level. VR is the future and you need to understand it.
**19 - Visual Space** | The next generation of web interfaces will be powered by strong UI with a touch of AI and 3D graphics. This is as close as we can get to the holodeck here in 2017.

**A few notes**
- This document will be constantly updated with the latest techniques in javascript.
- Currently this document is work in progress so be patient and keep revisiting the repository.
- I strongly discourage taking notes. This course is supposed to be your actual notebook so you can have your hands and mind free to work, not collecting and organising notes.
- **Remember** You will feel unconfortable for a long while. This is natural. This indicates progress, you are growing. Embrace this feeling, learn to love it. This is how you get ahead in life. Somewhere along the line you will make the transition and you will feel the true power of programming knowledge. Stay ambitious, don't throw the towel yet! Make me proud!

## Motivation for writting these tutorials
Confession: **I was a terrible student**. I always got bored and often I felt unable to keep the pace with the school curriculum. This has many explanations but the main one was that I felt a complete loss of freedom. When freedom is constrained you tend to loose motivation and interest. This has continued for me even after K12. I ended up being a dropout after just half of semester in economics university.

Somehow I was trapped between high hopes, big expectations, social pressure, impenetrable barriers and crushed dreams. Each time I started something new I lost steam quite fast and I ended ditching the plans just after a few weeks.

Yet, somehow **a miracle happened**... sort of. I had these two burning passions: technology and arts. I loved reading stuff about computers and browsing cool artwork online. Eventually this opened my way towards a career in webdesign. I spent a few years as a web designer with mixed results always trying to improve.

Eventually I took the big leap and I ventured into programming. It was a rough start. Everything was strange and nothing made sense. For a long period I felt a lot of **insecurity about my code and techniques**. Nothing that I built seemed to be even close to acceptable by the standards.

In time I got better and I made it on the other side. Today I'm leading a small, but growing, frontend team writting web applications used in the banking sector utilising the latest and greatest techniques. I have broad experience covering the full spectrum of the software development process. In the spare time I work at my own personal project which I hope to push into production in the near future.

Today it is really clear what were the past mistakes, were I have lost time and what were the roadblocks in this learning journey. I wish to share this knowledge with you in order to spare you the frustrations and possible failures that can occur during this period of learning. This is all about motivation and spatial orientation. A professional feels really good about himself when he is aware of the solutions that solve the problems he faces in his daily work. This is the feeling I wish to give you while finishing this course.

Now let's get busy creating web apps!

## Contributing
If you wish to expand this course with additional information or samples of your own code, please consider following the main principles behind this collection of tutorials. 
- Everything was conceived to be easy to digest by a beginner. 
- Each lesson tries to avoid going deep into detail, leaving this to be a decision made by the reader.
- 20/80 principle. 20% of the knowledge is used 80% of the time. We want to document this 20% of knowledge so that readers become aware of the backbone sustaining all this profession skills and how it can be extended with additional study.
- I really want that an ambitious person is able to read this course in 1 month and actually have a good feeling on how to start building his first app.

*THIS COURSE IS WORK IN PROGRESS*

*I am open to suggestions, answering questions and accepting contributions*

*This is work I do in my spare time, and it will take some effort until I finalize all the chapters. I am not a professional author and I cannot provide full coverage in all the topics. This is my own experience after years of work and I myself still have a lot to learn.* 

*Why GitHub?*

*I prefered a git repository instead of a blog because I am a ferm beliver in commented code. I belive this format will facilitate the transfer of information a lot more easily than using JsBin, JSfiddle or whatever tool. Nothing beat using an actual IDE together with a command line and Node server instance. There will be lots of npm content for many of the examples. A GIT tutorial is actualy the fastest way to transfer code samples. Also this is an excelent platform for other developers to contribute their experience. Plus there are no pesky advertisments here :D*
