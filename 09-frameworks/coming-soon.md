# Temporary notes until I write this chapter
*Ignore them*

Maps services, data services (observables), logic services, 
Reducers trigger maps, resolvers call the objects. 
This promotes code reuse. Use injector to bring services to reducer.
Maps and logic are allowed to use only pure funcitons, 
They are not allowed to have any state at all. 
Resolvers are init for pages, modules. 
Getting the initial state from the first run of the resolver is really cool. 
It's very clean, one weakness of clean code is that it can be so easily disturbed by novice devs. 
It also has to be fail safe.
If I cannot work with the app in the mind than it is sign of being too complicated.
How to find popular plugins
Lots of plugins have excess of features. For a long time I thought Im not good enough because of this.
Events – these are the user events such as click, change, input, submit, etc.XMLHttpRequests – Such thing occurs when we fetch data from a remote service.
Timers – when we use timer methods such as setTimeout (), setInterval (), etc.

Learning curve, 10000 litle steps, better than 1000 clifs.
