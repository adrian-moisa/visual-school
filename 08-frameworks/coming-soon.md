# Temporary notes until I write this chapter
*Ignore them*

Maps services, data services (observables), logic services, 
Reducers trigger maps, resolvers call the objects. 
This promotes code reuse. Use injector to bring services to reducer.
Maps and logic are allowed to use only pure funcitons, 
They are not allowed to have any state at all. 
Resolvers are init for pages, modules. 
Getting the initial state from the first run of the resolver is really cool. 
It's very clean, one weakness of clean code is that it can be so easily disturbed by novice devs. 
It also has to be fail safe.
If I cannot work with the app in the mind than it is sign of being too complicated.
How to find popular plugins
Lots of plugins have excess of features. For a long time I thought Im not good enough because of this.
Events – these are the user events such as click, change, input, submit, etc.XMLHttpRequests – Such thing occurs when we fetch data from a remote service.
Timers – when we use timer methods such as setTimeout (), setInterval (), etc.

When to go native and when to use a plugin.
Learning curve, 10000 litle steps, better than 1000 clifs.
declare var
Check the link sometimes libs have similar names. 
Why view encapsulation matters for styles. Form builder grilopu control. Custom control. 
Adding classes to cmps. Why adding from inside is better than writting in the template by hand as attributes.
Cannot find module
Sometimes I even need a diffchecker
Link to diffchecker
Link to regex edutor
Link to dillinger
Conemu
Powershell
Basic cmd commands
There is a lot of hidden knowledge behind code. Assume knowledge. Expected to be there. The less guess work the easier maintenace.  WHAT WHY.  
Do not put paddings margins in reusable cmps. Stick then from top
Write styles as if css encapsulation is disabled
CDN networks

Software lifecycle, versioning, expectatins, tired of the framework hype train. I expect JS to lieve at least 10 more years. building software to sustain in the future.

8 getter seters allow you to pass beyound intial faze of data bundigns. 
8 jsx and vdom better then dom aps. Polymer is abstracion lib. String attributes is annoyingm template. Data binding system. Poly has it's own template bindings. Jsx vs template bindings. 
8 Large vale qpps benefit from web comps. Miltiple stacks. Low scale just use livs 
8 InnerHtml. Code smell. Vendor lokin. Interoperability
8 React baseball cap. Bad idea. 
8 form dynamic binding
8 passing the callback in inputs instead of outputs binds the werong contwxt. Events are good for tying together smmal time ui actions like opening a sidebar. 
8 be careful not to invoke callbaks in the param

## React
JSX - Those who gave it some time realized that the concerns were better separated this way. Being able to holistically look at a component was great. Being able to actually compose and abstract nicely was great. Once your eyes could see past syntax, you realized that it maybe was a feature and not a bug.
Vue recommends using templates to build your HTML in the vast majority of cases. There are situations however, where you really need the full programmatic power of JavaScript. That’s where you can use the render function, a closer-to-the-compiler alternative to templates.
