## Let's talk about motivation

Ok. Let's face it, it's obvious by now. I told you a lie. You won't finish learning web apps in 4 weeks. That was not my plan anyway, that is unrealistic. But wait, before losing hope let's consider a bit what we are really trying to achieve. In 4 weeks I do wish that you are done reading my tutorials. But this does not mean you have stopped learining by revisiting them or by reading online. This is just the beginning. As I said multiple times, these tutorials are meant to give you the roadmap that you will follow in your own adventure.

## First understand the big picture, be efficient 

So you want to get fit and get your nice beach body. Well what do you do? Buy a gym subscribtion, right? Now what? What are the exercises? How long do you have to practice? What can you realistically expect? How do you actually stay motivated? How do you avoid embarasing accidents and injury?

Next best idea is to actually start doing some actual research. But then this is getting out of hand fast, so many contradicting ideas, everybody has their owm methodologies. You stumble upon lots of missconceptions and so an so. It takes ages... But maybe you get lucky and you find this nice book promising perfect abs in 4 weeks. The guy is nuts, he is doing bench presses with double what you weigh. This is definetly years of training... How can you even dream???

## Practice until the wheels fall off!
Ok, here is the kicker. Practice. Practice a lot. I'm doing you a huge service here. I am saving you precious practice time keeping you on the right path. I'm leading the way so that you don't have to waste time researching like mad. Did I mention I do it for free? What else do you need? 

There's a famous quote: **It takes 10/20 years to become an overnight success**. Well, I suppose this applies mainly for superstardom. If you desire to upgrade your career I will confidently say: **It takes 1/2 years to become an overnight successful developer**. But these years will be intensive... I mean really intensive. Daily reading. Kick out bad habbits. Stop wasting time on non-essential time. And do your gym training. At least 2,3 gym visits, or whatever you do. Don't destroy your health chasing money.

Currently, my average is 12 to 14 hours of work daily. Switching between 4 projects each week. I'm not saying that you need to do likewise. But you definetly need to reduce your Youtube, Facebook, Instragram and slacking around time. I had months on end of low motivation, close to almost depression. It's hard. Hardest thing ever to find motivation when you feel like giving up completely. Not easy. 

## The key is steady and constant progress

Let me teach you a secret. The key is not getting too deep into technical details. You don't need to do 200lbs bench presses. Do not loose too much steam in one place. When a lesson becomes tedious just skip it for god sake. Go ahead, find something refreshing, but always learn. Otherwise you might risk loosing the limited amount of motivation you have. Worst thing that can happen is actually feeling stressed by the fact that you need to start yet another lesson. This is where I put my bets that I have provided a balanced blend of useful content and fun stuff so that you get a nice steady stream of fun and interesting discoveries. The funny thing is that the more progress you make the more motivated you get and the more progress you ahieve. It's a self-enforcing feedback loop.

## I don't belive in setting goals, I belive in chasing pleasures
This leads me to the biggest secret of them all. I failed almost all my goals. I loose motivation as fast as a smartphone battery discharges. In several hours I'm done.  Never I have been able to achieve cold hard goals. Failing my golas made me feel even worse. I need to stay hooked on something addictive. The key for me was following my pleasures. I never stayed too deep in one area of study. I always chased buterflies that led me in new wonderful areas of web development. 

This might not be the case for everybody. Some people are just hell bent on success. Then good for you, why are you still reading my lame ass atempt at life coaching you?

## Conclusion
- Practice daily by having fun. 
- Don't discharge your energy in digesting stuff you cannot breakdown right now.
- Return later when you have stronger skills. 
- Ignore naysayers, prove them wrong. Show it is possible!
- Keep digging!
- Don't forget to take breaks :) 

May the code be with you!
