Startups. Corporate vs Shop vs startup
How is it working as a freelnacer / hired
Only profile, public persone, website, github profile, twitter.
Using IE 11 tools for debugging feels like hunting rats with bow and arrow... that's why I started with archery classes 
How to structure code in files. init on top. Sorted imports, Avoid weird compoents. Properties should have more meaningul names and less componets about them. Having to use addons for this issue is annoying, whenever you switch this not easy.
Taking ownership and responsibility
13 quickly write a table usin alt shift
13 Production ready. Release candidate.
13 Addingfeatures. Onboardng new members.

## Code quality
Mistake: Sass CSS variables were overkill
Demonstrate bootstap grid
Really annoying when angular removes connections. SASS and webpack make it really hard to trace back soruce styles
14 Header menu needs z index 2 for dropdowns
14 Menu drodowns. Links need paddings in order  to avoid too much nesting.
14 Use minumal nesting
14 Width calc
14 Keep elastic header and content with flexbox
14 Adding classes to cmps. Why adding from inside is better.
14 separate app layout
14 Do not put paddings margins in reusable cmps. Stick then from top
14 Encapsulation hos. Container wrapper. 
14 Do I really need redux form?
14 all comps shiuld be elastoc from the veginning. 
14 Better to have them separated than nested the exapandable sidebar. Sidebar.second.col
14 The toggle visibility pattern for ng comps with redux.
14 always css class is first

Inspecting performance with taks manager, perforamnce tab.
