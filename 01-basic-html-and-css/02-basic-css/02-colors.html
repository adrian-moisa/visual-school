    <h2>How to use the integrated browser color picker</h2>
    <h3>Open developer tools panel</h3>
    <p>
        In case you are not aware of color pickers I will bring them to your attention.
        The color picker is a tool used very often in web development and not just by designers.
        In order to use it you have to open developer tools panel.
        To open it usually you have to access main menu and there you will find developer tools in almost all browsers.
        Or you can press F12. Most browsers should open developer tools.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Select a HTML element contaning text</h3>
    <p>
        If this is your first visit there, don't panic. Ignore most of the stuff you see there.
        Usually you will see a panel called "Console" which should be mostly white.
        This is not what we need. Look for a panel called "Elements".
        After opening "Elements" you should see some HTML in the main view.
        Just click on any of these tags and on the right side you should see a panel with CSS rules.
        For the moment just ignore them.
        First one should usually be named element.style {}
    </p>
    
    <h3>Change the color of the text live</h3>
    <p>
        One cool thing you can do with developer tools is to change the page without actually saving or refreshing.
        This is done on the fly and the changes will be lost on refresh
        Try typing there color hit "enter" and than type "red", enter again.
        The way you enter CSS instructions in dev tools is a bit cumbersone unfortunately, it takes a bit of practice.
        Now you should see some red text there.
        Feel free to try the other notations aswell.
        Notice that when you type wrong syntax a striketrough will appear, indicating that the rule is not active.
        We will talk more about dev tolls in the upcoming chapters. 
        Right now remember F12 to open dev tools and the CSS panel for live edits and experiments.
    </p>
    
    
    <h3>Now let's try a few experiments with colors</h3>

                            <!-- This is not part of the lesson itself. -->
                            <!-- I need a way to showcase the colors that I'm using down bellow. -->
                            <!-- Just ignore this for the moment> I will explain later how it works. -->
                            <!-- Of course, avoid inline styles :D -->
                            <!-- Also adding extra tabs is not a recommended technique but 
                                I really need to emphasyze that these tags should be ignored. -->
                            <!-- However this is also a good occasion to show you how some real CSS code might look like. -->

        <h2>Friendly reminder, these are just demo samples</h2>
        <p>
            One of my first grudges when I was learning HTML and CSS it was that I it was really hard to figure out 
                how to use the newly learned lessons for actual work.
            I mean, this demo looks prety technical and unlike any other webpage you have seen.
            It's like buying a fancy 4K LED TV and displaying the color correction grid on it.
            Righ now I'm under pressure to deliver under a short amount of time but I promise to return back later 
                and link to proper samples of code that actually showcase real life situations.
            This will most likely happen later on in the more advanced chapters when we start building some real life web apps.
            I will use samples from there to demonstrate here what are some actual uses cases of these properties.
            This will apply for all the upcoming lessons.
